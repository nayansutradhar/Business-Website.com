      <p>In most business plans, the company description is included in the section that directly follows the executive summary. The business description is meant to provide an overview of the business, including what the business does and how the company is unique from others in the same industry. This description provides extensive details outlining the business. In addition to outlining goals and how the goals are going to be met, it includes where the company is located and how many people are going to be employed.

        It also gives a detailed overview of the vision and direction of the business; this helps lenders and stakeholders develop a realistic picture of who and what the business are. A business description varies from one company to the next. Generally, though, it will need to look similar to the following:
        
        The official name of the business
        Where the business' operations are going to be conducted
        Type of structure (sole proprietorship, LLC, partnership, or corporation)
        Names of the people who own the company and any senior-level employees
        The address of the company's headquarters
        Date the business was started
        How the company came to be
        Goals the company needs to meet
        Mission statement; this outlines the purpose of the business
        What is being sold and the market segment being targeted
        Future goals (both short- and long-term)
        Vision statement; what is your vision of the company's futur</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">Each line on an FIDS indicates a different flight number accompanied by:

                      the airline name/logo and/or its IATA or ICAO airline designator (can also include names/logos of interlining/codesharing airlines or partner airlines, e.g. HX252/BR2898.)
                      the city of origin or destination, and any intermediate points
                      the expected arrival or departure time and/or the updated time (reflecting any delays)
                      the gate number
                      the check-in counter numbers or the name of the airline handling the check-in
                      the status of the flight, such as "Landed", "Delayed", "Boarding", etc.
                      Due to code sharing, a flight may be represented by a series of different flight numbers. For example, LH 474 and AC 9099, both partners of Star Alliance, codeshare on a route using a single aircraft, either Lufthansa or Air Canada, to operate that route at that given time. Lines may be sorted by time, airline name, or city.
                      
                      Most FIDS are now displayed on LCD or LED screen, although some airports still use split-flap display..</p>
